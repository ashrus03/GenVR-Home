GenVR Home – Generative AI Landing Page

This project is the official landing page for GenVR, a generative AI platform designed to provide immersive, creative tools for image manipulation, 2D-to-3D model conversion, and content generation. Developed using modern web technologies, it serves as a dynamic frontend interface optimized for performance, responsiveness, and scalability.

Technical Architecture

Framework & Libraries: Built with vanilla HTML5 and CSS3, utilizing Bootstrap 5.3 for a responsive grid system, utility classes, and component structure. Interactive elements are managed using native JavaScript and Bootstrap’s JS bundle.

UI Components:

* Carousel for visual storytelling using multiple slides and indicators.
* Feature Grid powered by row-cols and icon-square layouts for modular presentation of GenVR’s core capabilities.
* Testimonial & FAQ Sections styled semantically for credibility and user engagement.

Styling and Theming:

* Custom CSS (style.css) includes scoped section themes (#features, #testimonial, #FAQs) using deep tones and gradients to enhance visual hierarchy.
* Use of CSS variables, backdrop filters, and border-radius stylings to support dark-mode design principles and modern aesthetics.
* SVG icons and image containers are styled responsively with controlled dimensions (rem units) and accessibility considerations.

Features Highlighted

* 2D to 3D Image Conversion using AI-driven backend (not covered in frontend repo, but referenced as part of user journey).
* Generative Art & Editing Interface previewed through static CTA and carousel components.
* Cross-platform Accessibility ensured by using mobile-first design and no hardware dependency (cloud-based architecture referenced in FAQs).

Optimization & Best Practices

* Fully compliant with semantic HTML standards and ARIA-compatible Bootstrap components.
* Uses lazy-load carousel logic for image transitions, improving perceived performance.
* File structure follows clean separation of concerns (HTML/CSS split), ensuring maintainability and ease of extension for future features.
